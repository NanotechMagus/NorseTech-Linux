# a Marymount University capstone project for the summer of 2020.
# See ../license.rst for MIT license.

# The goal of this program is to watch for any plugged in media through dmesg, then
# automate the bitstream process, securing the data in a secure file container using
# sfsimage, a shell script created by Bruce Nikkel. This image will then be analyzed using
# /tools/analysis.py to generate a PDF in the specified folder where the sfs image resides.
